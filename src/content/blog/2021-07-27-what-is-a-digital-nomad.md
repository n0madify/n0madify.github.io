# What is a digital nomad?

Starting with the obvious, what exactly is a Digital Nomad? To put it plainly, the term describes individuals that can leverage telecommunication to work from virtually anywhere while living a nomadic lifestyle. Living a nomadic lifestyle can be left to interpretation but it generally means that nomads do not live in the same location for very long.

> Happiness is a journey, not a destination

With that in mind, not every nomad is created equal. Living a nomadic lifestyle does come with a bit of judgment but not all nomads live in tents. Easier options include:

* Vacation Rentals
* Short term rentals
* Hostels
* Recreational Vehicles
* Staying with family/friends

## Why did we decide to become Digital Nomads?
As you may have guessed, this decision was greatly accelerated by the rise of remote work caused by nothing less than a global pandemic in 2020.

After a period of adjustment, the tech industry as a whole seemed to realize that 2020 was a turning point in terms of our work habits and environment. Preconceived notions about our "need for offices" were quickly foiled when increases in productivity were noticed as a result of these changes. Week after week, new companies made announcements regarding their new remote work policies. Some decided to shut down offices completely while others decided to create flexible work environments that would be used once the various pandemic related lockdowns ended. 
 
Before 2020, we always enjoyed knowing that our technical work allowed us to work remotely. We dreamt of continuing to do what we did on a day to day, but to be able to relocate and work in a warmer climate, or to live in different cities one at a time. 
   
We previously enjoyed the thought of working remotely, but never felt we really could. After the impact of the pandemic, it became clear that those feelings were baseless. Not only was remote work allowing us to operate as well or better than we had in the past, but it also offered a number of advantages.

## What are the advantages of being Digital Nomads?
So what's the point, if you can work from anywhere why not simply work from the comfort of your own house? If you remember the feeling of moving into your first apartment or house, you may recall the excitement of discovering a new place and perhaps even exploring a new area for the first time. From finding your new favorite coffee shop to visiting all of the sights nearby, that general feeling of excitement is not easy to come by. But what if you could live your life in a way that allowed you to experience that feeling whenever you wished? That is what Digital Nomadism can offer.

Other advantages include living a simple life. Although Minimalism and Nomadism are two different types of lifestyles, they do go very well together. Limiting your amount of possessions helps free your mind from materialistic thinking and of course, helps with keeping your frequent relocations easy.
